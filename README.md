# Secure_password_generator
                    Version 0.01
 The idea of the project is to create a secure and easy to use
 'random password generator'.
 
 Following the newest recommendations for password, which are:
  <br>*At least 2 numbers
  <br>*At least 2 symbols
  <br>*At least 2 lowercase characters
  <br>*At least 2 uppercase characters
  <br>
  There will be a test if the user has given correct input of
  number of characters of each.
