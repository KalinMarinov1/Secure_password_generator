# Secure_password_generator

                    Version 1.00
It seems that the code is ready and is generating seemingly 
secure and useful passwords that i may use with length of at least 12
<br>
<br>It is generated by appending at empty string:
<br> *generating a number, a symbol, lowercase char, uppercase char
<br> *the cycle continues as low as 2, and as high as 10 times
<br> The user is asked "How many chars of each? :"
<br> By entering 2, it will generate a password of length 8, lowest 
<br>possible size for secure password

<br>
<br> Now here's a list of several generated password :
<br> sizeofeach(2) : "5u-SdK_7" , "u_4P-Xd3", "X=R,5vs2" <br>
<br> sizeofeach(3) : "kQ-7p,IG$47m" , "8$NdeKp@5-7H", "]M]23A7i.cfC" <br>
<br> sizeofeach(4) : "_!H2[y482sVtOW]i" , "#8-nP76.@ESSmt4y",
<br><br>And so on,
<br> 
<br>

                    Version 0.01
 The idea of the project is to create a secure and easy to use
 'random password generator'.
 
 Following the newest recommendations for password, which are:
  <br>*At least 2 numbers
  <br>*At least 2 symbols
  <br>*At least 2 lowercase characters
  <br>*At least 2 uppercase characters
  <br>
  There will be a test if the user has given correct input of
  number of characters of each.
